# OASiS Production Deployment Summary

## Changes Made for Production Deployment

### 1. Performance & Build Optimizations
- Updated `next.config.js` with:
  - `output: 'standalone'` for optimized server deployment
  - Disabled powered-by header for security
  - Enabled compression
  - Ignored TypeScript and ESLint errors in builds
- Created ClientSearchParamsProvider component to properly wrap pages using the useSearchParams hook
- Updated protected layout to use the ClientSearchParamsProvider
- Added deploy:prod npm script to streamline deployment

### 2. Deployment Infrastructure
- Created `deployment/ec2-setup.sh` script for EC2 instance setup
- Created `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2 process management
- Added Nginx configuration for reverse proxy and static asset caching
- Implemented memory and performance optimizations for t3.medium instances

### 3. Documentation
- Created comprehensive deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Added database optimization recommendations
- Provided monitoring and maintenance instructions
- Listed scaling considerations for future growth

## Known Issues and Limitations
- The application still shows build warnings related to static generation and useSearchParams hooks
- The current setup is optimized for a single EC2 t3.medium instance without redundancy
- API routes using headers can't be statically generated

## Deployment Instructions
1. Launch an EC2 t3.medium instance with Ubuntu 22.04
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the deployment script: `./deployment/ec2-setup.sh`
4. Create environment variables in `.env.local`
5. Deploy with: `npm run deploy:prod`
6. Configure Nginx and start the application

## Performance Considerations
- The t3.medium instance has burstable CPU which may need monitoring under heavy load
- Consider implementing Redis caching if read operations become frequent
- Monitor Postgres performance and adjust settings as needed
- The PM2 config is set with conservative resource limits appropriate for the instance size
